## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- Two layers were chosen and along with the output layer were chosen for the original model.  There were 80 neurons in the first layer and 30 in the second.  The activation for layer 1 and layer 2 were relu and for the output layer was sigmoid.  [Original_model]() shows that the accuracy rate for the original model was 73.42%

- The result of 75% accuracy was not acheived after the 3 attempts

-The following steps were taken to attempt to increase the model performance
	- [Attempt#1]() increased number of neurons in a layer and an accuracy of 73.44% was acheived
	- [Attempt#2]() increase the neural layers and an accuracy of 73.34% was acheived
	- [Attempt#3]() change number of neurons in layers and change the type of activation and an accuracy of 73.41% was acheived

# Recommendation
